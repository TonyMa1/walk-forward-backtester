Clear, modular project structure that mirrors best practices for Python projects in quantitative finance.

Detailed, comprehensive documentation within the code itself to facilitate easy verification of the implementation against the source material.

Robust and thorough testing to ensure the reproduced project functions exactly as described.

Focus on code readability, maintainability, and adherence to Python best practices for future development and understanding.

AI-friendly coding practices to effectively leverage AI assistance throughout the reproduction process, while maintaining strict verification against the source documentation.

**Follow the following rules STRICTLY to ensure accurate project reproduction and high-quality code.  Violation of these rules is unacceptable.**

---

**1.  Code Clarity and Comprehensive Documentation (Priority #1):**

*   **Mandatory Typing Annotations:** For every Python file you modify or create, ALWAYS add comprehensive and accurate typing annotations to each function, method, and class.  This includes specifying return types explicitly, even if they are `None`.
*   **Detailed Descriptive Docstrings (PEP 257 Compliance):** ALWAYS add detailed, descriptive docstrings to ALL Python functions, classes, and modules.  Adhere strictly to the pep257 docstring conventions.
    *   **Source Material References:** Docstrings MUST explicitly reference the section or relevant part of the source documentation that the code implements.  This is absolutely crucial for verification and traceability. For example, if a function implements an algorithm described in "Section 3 of the documentation," the docstring should clearly state: "Implements the algorithm described in the source documentation, Section 3."
    *   **Example Usage (Where Applicable):**  Include clear and concise example usage within the docstrings, especially for functions and classes that are designed to be used by other parts of the project.
    *   **Update Existing Docstrings:** If existing docstrings are insufficient, lack source references, or do not fully explain the functionality, update them to meet these requirements.
*   **Comprehensive Comments:** Maintain all existing comments in the files. Add new comments to clarify complex logic, algorithmic steps, or any non-obvious implementation details.  Comments are especially important when translating formulas or procedures from the source material into code.

**2. Modular and Structured Project Organization:**

*   **Standard Project Structure:** Organize the project with a clear and conventional structure.  Use directories like `src` for all source code, `tests` for all tests, and potentially `docs` if documentation generation becomes relevant.
    *   **`src` Modules:** Within the `src` directory, create modules (subdirectories with `__init__.py`) to group related functionalities. Consider modules such as:
        *   `strategies/`: For trading strategy implementations.
        *   `data_handling/` or `data/`: For data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing utilities.
        *   `backtesting/`: For backtesting engine components.
        *   `risk_management/`: For risk analysis and management tools (if applicable).
        *   `portfolio_optimization/`: For portfolio optimization algorithms (if applicable).
        *   `utils/` or `helpers/`: For general utility functions and helper classes.
    *   **Dedicated Files:** Create distinct Python files within these modules for models, services, utilities, and any other logical components.  For example, within `strategies/`, you might have `moving_average_crossover.py`, `rsi_strategy.py`, etc.  This modular approach is essential for clarity and verifiability.
    *   **Create `__init__.py`:** Ensure that `__init__.py` files exist in `src`, `tests`, and within any subdirectories in `src` or `tests` if they are missing.

**3. Robust and Thorough Testing with Pytest (Mandatory):**

*   **Dedicated `./tests` Directory:** ALL tests MUST reside in a dedicated `./tests` directory at the project root.
*   **Pytest Framework:** Use the pytest framework for all testing.
*   **Comprehensive Test Suites:** Write comprehensive unit tests to rigorously verify the correctness of your implementation.  Testing is paramount to ensure accurate reproduction of the project's functionality as documented in the source material.
    *   **Isolate Components:** Focus on unit tests that isolate and test individual functions, classes, and modules based on their documented behavior in the source material.
    *   **Test Edge Cases and Error Conditions:** Where the source documentation describes specific edge cases or error handling behavior, write tests to explicitly verify these scenarios.
    *   **Integration Tests (Consider Later):**  After thorough unit testing, consider adding integration tests to verify the correct interaction between different components of the project.
*   **Type-Annotated Tests with Docstrings:** All test files, test functions, and test methods MUST be fully type-annotated and include detailed docstrings.
    *   **Test Docstring Purpose:** Test docstrings should clearly explain what is being tested, the expected behavior, and MUST reference the specific section(s) or relevant part of the source documentation that validate the expected behavior.
*   **Import for Type Checking in Tests:** In every test file, include the following import block for type hinting pytest fixtures:
    ```python
    from typing import TYPE_CHECKING
    if TYPE_CHECKING:
        from _pytest.capture import CaptureFixture
        from _pytest.fixtures import FixtureRequest
        from _pytest.logging import LogCaptureFixture
        from _pytest.monkeypatch import MonkeyPatch
        from pytest_mock.plugin import MockerFixture
    ```
*   **Test-Driven Approach (Recommended):** Ideally, write tests *before* or *alongside* implementing the code. This test-driven approach helps ensure that the code accurately meets the specifications in the source material.

**4. Dependency Management and Strict Code Style:**

*   **Document Dependencies:**  Identify and document all Python package dependencies required by the project. Create a `requirements.txt` file in the project root and list all dependencies with version specifications if mentioned in the source or necessary for reproducibility.
*   **Mandatory Ruff Formatting and Linting:** Maintain strict code style consistency using Ruff. Apply Ruff formatting to all Python code to ensure clean, readable, and consistently styled code. Run Ruff linting and address all reported issues to adhere to Python best practices.  Code MUST pass Ruff checks.

**5. Configuration and Error Handling (Address if Documented):**

*   **Configuration:** If the source documentation mentions any configuration parameters, settings, or environment variables, implement configuration management accordingly.
*   **Error Handling:** If the source describes specific error handling mechanisms or expected error conditions, implement robust error handling in the code to match.

**6. CI/CD and Advanced Features (Defer for Initial Reproduction):**

*   CI/CD implementation and other advanced features are not required for the initial reproduction phase. Focus on achieving a functional, well-tested, and documented project first.

**7. AI-Assisted Development and Verification:**

*   **Leverage AI Tools Effectively:** Utilize AI tools like Cursor to accelerate development. Use AI for tasks such as generating boilerplate code, assisting with typing annotations and docstrings, and suggesting code improvements.
*   **Critical Verification Against Source:**  **CRITICALLY REVIEW AND VERIFY ALL AI-GENERATED CODE AGAINST THE SOURCE DOCUMENTATION.**  AI assistance is valuable, but accuracy is paramount.  Do not blindly accept AI suggestions.  Always double-check that the generated code precisely implements what is described in the source.  Pay close attention to formulas, algorithms, and logical steps.
*   **AI for Understanding:** Use AI to help you understand complex sections of code or algorithms described in the source documentation. Ask specific, targeted questions to clarify your understanding and ensure accurate implementation.

---

**By adhering to these optimized rules with strict discipline, you will create a GitHub repository that is:**

*   **An Accurate Reproduction:** Faithfully implements the project described in the source documentation.
*   **Well-Documented:** Contains comprehensive docstrings and comments with clear references to the source material.
*   **Thoroughly Tested:** Includes robust pytest test suites to guarantee functionality.
*   **Modular and Well-Structured:** Organized for clarity, maintainability, and easy verification.
*   **High-Quality Code:** Adheres to Python best practices and is formatted and linted with Ruff.

This approach will maximize the educational value of the project, make it an excellent portfolio piece, and demonstrate your ability to implement quantitative finance projects with rigor and precision.

**Remember: Accuracy and Verifiability are the top priorities.**  Start with a deep understanding of the source, break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks, and meticulously follow these rules throughout the development process. Good luck!
